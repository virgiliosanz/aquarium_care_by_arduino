*** Architecture
I am using the Arduino Logic for all my classes. I mean, they have a
constructor, destructor and a setup and loop methods at the minimum.

I am also following the logic for actuators and sensors. I treat them that
way.

I believe the more dificult part is the LCD and the Rotary Encoder (..and
		switch button). For that I am using the "State" Pattern as described in:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern.
Implemented as follows:

- //Context// is implemented in the //Interfaze// class
- //State//  is implemented in the //Screen// class
- //Concrete States// are implemented in //Screen[0-N]// classes
